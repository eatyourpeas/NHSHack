We are a group of coders, illustrators, designers, medics, nurses and dieticians. 

On 16/7 May 2015 we came together at an NHSHackDay in London to design some simple games to teach children and their families with type 1 diabetes to carb count. We took third prize.

We created Jamie the Giraffe, who navigates the milky way learning about diabetes on the way, avoiding the evil Captain Ketone.

It is written in Node JS using the Phaser framework. Diabetes resources are provided by Chris Cheyette, Dietician at King's College Hospital in London and author of Carbs&Cals, a popular resource for people with T1 Diabetes.
